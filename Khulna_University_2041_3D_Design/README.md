Project Description : We made a 3D model of 2041 Khulna University.It is a 3D game Where users can walk and see what's around.We Used Blender to create a 2D model.Then we made 3D model using Blender-osm. We used the unreal engine to make it more realistic. But we faced problem doing so, as the unreal engine doesn't support texturing. We managed to do texturing on our own. This project will show you how we want to see our Khulna University in 2041.
